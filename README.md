# Birthday Reminder

I created a birthday-reminder app using this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_7Z7C_JCyo.

* This is my first React apps.
* Used create-react-app.
* Practiced using useState, importing and exporting components, and deconstructing objects.
* Changed some of the CSS. See below for more detailed CSS changes.
* The app lists five people with their corresponding names, ages, and images from the data.js file.
* Clicking the button "Clear All" removes all of the people from the list.

## My personal tweaks:
* Added remove button with remove functionality next to each person.
* Background color of both the body and the clear all button.
* Border-radius of the images from 50% to 25%. 
* Text sizes.
* Added italics to the age and years text.
* Enlarged the heading text, centered it, and added an underline.


## CSS
* Style.css was copied from the tutorial.
