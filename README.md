Birthday-reminder

I created a birthday-reminder app using this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_7Z7C_JCyo.

This is one of my first React apps.
I used create-react-app.
I practiced using useState, importing and exporting components, and deconstructing objects.
I also changed some of the CSS. See below for more detailed CSS changes.
The app lists five people with their corresponding names, ages, and images from the data.js file.
Clicking the button "Clear All" removes all of the people from the list.

CSS
The style.css was copied from the tutorial.

My personal tweaks:
I changed the background color of both the body and the clear all button. I changed the border-radius of the images from 50% to 25%. I changed some of the text sizes. Added italics to the age and years text. Enlarged the heading text, centered it, and added an underline. Added remove button with remove functionality next to each person.
