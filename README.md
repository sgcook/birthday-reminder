Birthday-reminder

I created a birthday-reminder app using this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_7Z7C_JCyo.

This is one of my first React apps.
I used create-react-app.
I practiced using useState, importing and exporting components, and deconstructing objects.
The app lists five people with their corresponding names, ages, and images from the data.js file.
Clicking the button "Clear All" removes all of the people from the list.
The style.css was copied from the tutorial.
